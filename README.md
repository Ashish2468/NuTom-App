Simply declare the method in your event `Popup.show({...})` in its component.

```
<Root>
    <View>
        <TouchableOpacity
            onPress={() =>
              Popup.show({
                type: 'Success',
                title: 'Upload complete',
                button: false,
                textBody: 'Congrats! Your upload successfully done',
                buttonText: 'Ok',
                callback: () => Popup.hide()
              })
            }
        >
            <Text>Open Popup</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>

                onPress={() => 
                    Toast.show({
                        title: 'User created',
                        text: 'Your user was successfully created, use the app now.',
                        color: '#2ecc71'
                    })
                }
            >
